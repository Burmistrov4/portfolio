# React Component Creaction

Every function, class, or component must include a JSDoc block directly above its definition for documentation.

At minimum, include:

`@description` explaining what the component does.

`@param` for each input (with type and description).

`@returns` (or `@returns {void}` if nothing is returned).

Keep descriptions short, clear, and written in plain English.
